# File Organizer - Python

You don't want to organize your files. Nobody does. So, here is a file organizer made in Python.

## List of extensions supported

- pdf
- png
- jpg
- jpeg
- gif
- doc
- docx
- txt
- csv
- xlsx
- zip
- rar
- exe
- mp3
- wav
- mp4
- avi
- flv
- wmv

## How it works?

Basically, you tell the script the path to the folder you want to organize. The script then take a look at the files extension and move it to their corresponding folders.

## Why?

I only did it for study purposes. Maybe it's not in the best design it could be, but it is better than doing nothing at all.
